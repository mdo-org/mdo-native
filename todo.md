# To-Do

- [ ] warn user before going back if changes are pending
      I want to make sure local changes are not lost if the user forgets to press save
- [ ] allow creating new files.
- [ ] allow adding a new block at the start of a file.
- [ ] allow deleting blocks
- [ ] review [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)
      it might be a way to import an MDo flow dynamically
