# To-Do

- [ ] render error messages in a modal.
- [ ] allow creating new files.
- [ ] allow adding a new block at the start of a file.
- [ ] allow reloading a file by "pulling down"
- [ ] remove the "Log out" option when a file is open.
      we don't want to accidentally log out when touching "Run MDo"
- [ ] split "Run MDo" from "Save"
      we should have separate buttons on the menu, one for save, another for mdo.
- [ ] auto-save when file is exit or screen is blocked.
      I want to make sure local changes are not lost if the user forgets to press save
- [ ] review [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)
      it might be a way to import an MDo flow dynamically
- [ ] add confirmation before logout
