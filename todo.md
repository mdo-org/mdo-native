# To-Do

- [ ] allow creating new files.
- [ ] auto-save when file is exit or screen is blocked.
      I want to make sure local changes are not lost if the user forgets to press save
- [ ] add "Undo Changes" button to File Editor
  - add a confirmation dialog
- [ ] allow adding a new block at the start of a file.
- [ ] allow reloading a file by "pulling down"
- [ ] add confirmation dialgo for "Log out" option
- [ ] review [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)
      it might be a way to import an MDo flow dynamically
- [ ] add confirmation before logout
