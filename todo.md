# To-Do

- [ ] allow reloading a file

- [ ] add "Undo Changes" button to File Editor

  - add a confirmation dialog

- [ ] allow creating new files.

      I want to make sure local changes are not lost if the user forgets to press save
- [ ] allow adding a new block at the start of a file.
- [ ] allow deleting blocks
- [ ] review [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)
