# MDoNative
React Native app for [MDo](https://mdo-org.github.io/mdo/).

## Getting Started
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v10.15.0 preferred)
2. Start the expo server with `yarn install && yarn start`.

### Running the app on your phone
1. Install the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) on your phone.
2. Using the Expo app on your phone, scan the provided QR code and wait until the app is loaded.

### Running the app on a virtual android device
1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Open "AVD Manager" from `Android studio > Configure > AVD Manager`
3. Create and start a new Virtual Device
4. On the terminal tab where you started the expo server, type `a`. The expo server will then install Expo on the virtual device and start your app.

Note: to "shake" your android virtual device, press `Ctrl + m` (on Linux). You'll see the React Native dev menu pop up.
